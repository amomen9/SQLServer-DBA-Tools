## 1. Foreword üìñ

* Sometimes you might need to set up a cluster which spans multiple subnets and separate VLANs. The nodes in this cluster need to communicate using intermediary routing devices. A single datacenter can have multiple subnets. A multi-subnet AlwaysOn cluster is recommended for replicas that are situated in the same datacenter with strong and stable network connection.  
* However, please note that if your multi-subnet cluster should span over a cross-datacenter architecture with separate geolocations for disaster recovery purposes, a **Distributed Availability Group (`DAG`)** is a better solution and has some advantages over traditional AlwaysOn clusters.  
* Also, as another remedy, you can create a virtual network on top of physically separated LANs using `SDN` solutions with only one subnet. This way, the AlwaysOn cluster can be created on an ordinary single-subnet network.

---

## 2. Preliminaries and Prerequisites ‚úÖ

* This document uses `Windows Server 2019` and `SQL Server 2019`. Later, it was tested on `Windows Server 2025` and `SQL Server 2022`.
* This document assumes that you have full control over your domain, servers, and network. If you do not, you have to refer to respective infrastructure teams for your environment.
* The full process for creating a SQL Server Availability Group is not explained here‚Äîonly the difference between single-subnet and multi-subnet Availability Group setup is mentioned. For single-subnet details please refer to online materials.

## 3. Test Case Specific IP Addresses üåê

Below are the IP addresses used for the test case:

### 3.1 Core Servers

| Role  | IP Address        |
|-------|-------------------|
| DC    | 192.168.241.240   |
| Node1 | 192.168.241.111   |
| Node2 | 192.168.241.112   |
| Node3 (Secondary Subnet) | 10.10.10.113 |

### 3.2 Cluster & Listener

| Type        | IP Addresses (Multi-Subnet) |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Cluster     | 192.168.241.114 & 10.10.10.114 |
| Listener    | 192.168.241.115 & 10.10.10.115 |

### 3.3 Routers (Gateways Between Subnets)

| Subnet | Gateway IP |
|--------|------------|
| 192.168.241.x | 192.168.241.2 |
| 10.10.10.x    | 10.10.10.1    |

## 4. Port Requirements üîå

Aside from mandatory `TCP` ports for SQL Server service (`1433` and `1434` for default instance) and endpoints (usually `5022`), the port `3343` is required for the cluster. You need to make sure it is reachable from every node to every other node.

> No extra services or applications are installed on these VMs except `OpenSSH` (not mandatory). Only necessary applications were installed from raw Windows Server installation.

Here is a list of open listening TCP ports on the nodes that are not present on a raw Windows Server 2019 computer on a domain:

![1736749076070](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749076070.png)

Having these extra ports is recommended when setting up the Availability Group Cluster.

* `5357` ‚Üí **Web Services on Devices (WSD) API**
* `5985` ‚Üí **WinRM / PowerShell remoting (HTTP)**
* `9389` ‚Üí **Active Directory Web Services (ADWS)**

## 5. List of Test Case Open Listening Ports in Detail üìä

Here is a major list of listening ports (apart from dynamic ports) in the test case on different servers.

| Server | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| DC     | Screenshot below |

![1736749103871](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749103871.png)

Simple raw Windows Server ports:

![1736749120260](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749120260.png)

> For the `5985` or `5986` ports to be listening, PowerShell Remoting over HTTP or HTTPS must be enabled.

The UDP ports serve the same subnet.

The intersection (`intersect`) of Node1, Node2, and Node3 listening TCP ports:

![1736749141896](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749141896.png)

> Note: Port `22` is for `OpenSSH` and is NOT mandatory; port `5022` is the chosen SQL Server endpoint port.

If you have malfunctions in your cluster/AG, you can use a port scanner to see which ports are active and responding.

## 6. Joining a Different Subnet Server to the Domain üîÅ

Make sure that your `DNS` and `Active Directory` services have the required configurations. A sample of the DNS Server's IP configuration:

![1736749163671](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749163671.png)

The gateway must be a router‚Äôs IP on your LAN which routes your server to the second subnet.

### 6.1 Steps in DNS Manager üõ†Ô∏è

1. Go to `DNS Manager`.
2. Right-click on `Reverse Lookup Zones` ‚Üí click `New Zone`.

   ![1736749190148](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749190148.png)
   
   ![1736749238141](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749238141.png)
   
3. Choose the preferred zone type.

   ![1736749263628](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749263628.png)
   
4. Choose the secondary subnet IP version and click `Next`.

   ![1736749309396](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749309396.png)
   
5. Enter `Network ID` and click `Next`.

   ![1736749326724](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749326724.png)
   
6. Follow wizard screens:

   ![1736750120710](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750120710.png)
   
   ![1736750136563](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750136563.png)
   
   ![1736750178489](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750178489.png)
   
7. Sample IPv4 address configuration on 2 nodes (DNS server specification is important for joining the domain and finding the domain controller):
   
   ![1736749362458](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736749362458.png)
   
   a. Same subnet:  
   
   ![1736750213620](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750213620.png)  
   
   b. Secondary subnet:  
   
   ![1736750222123](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750222123.png)
   
8. Continue with reverse zone completion:

   ![1736750239253](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750239253.png)

### 6.2 Summary for Adding a Secondary Subnet Server to the Domain üìù

Joining servers on the same subnet as the domain controller is easy. For a multi-subnet network:

* You must manually add the secondary subnet reverse zones to the DNS server.
* Servers (same or secondary subnet) must define a DNS server capable of resolving the domain name.
* If you get an error that the specified domain cannot be contacted, common causes include:
  - Missing DNS server configuration.
  - Try entering the `Root domain name` or `FQDN` (NetBIOS might not resolve otherwise).
* If you get a SID error during domain join, you have improperly cloned your VM. Run `Sysprep` to fix this.

## 7. Setting Up Multi-Subnet SQL Server 2019 AlwaysOn HA üß©

### 7.1 Brief Steps

![1736750311755](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn/1736750311755.png)

| Nodes (Example) |
|-----------------|
| **192.168.241.111** |
| **192.168.241.112** |
| **10.10.10.113**    |

3. Cluster validation wizard steps:

6. Node validation summary:  

   ![1736789373022](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789373022.png)

A warning shows up:

![1736789392227](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789392227.png)

Storage validation is unimportant right now:

![1736789400726](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789400726.png)

> This warning strongly recommends that the link between nodes is highly available and fault tolerant. Disregarded for the test case.

## 8. Setting Up the AlwaysOn Availability Group Role for the Cluster üõ°Ô∏è

1. Begin AG creation:

   ![1736789549757](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789549757.png)
   
2. Availability Group wizard steps:

   ![1736789573225](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789573225.png)

2. In the `New Availability Group` wizard, listener IP addresses for both subnets should be defined:

![1736789573225](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy/1736789573225.png)

The rest of the configurations are very similar to single-subnet Availability Group configurations.

## 9. Conclusion and Notable Points vs Single-Subnet AG üßæ

After joining secondary subnet servers to the domain, the cluster and AlwaysOn AG can be created normally with these multi-subnet concepts:

* When setting the IP for the cluster, you must set an IP for each subnet (two IPs total). Only one of these IP addresses can be online at a time.
* When setting up a listener for the AG, specify a listener IP for each subnet (two IPs total). Only one listener IP is online at a time per cluster state.

# üìé Appendix

## 1. Some Details About the Cluster and Listener Behaviors üîç

We know that the primary server holds the IP of the listener on its interfaces‚Äîcalling the listener‚Äôs IP address on the network results in the **primary server responding**.

`ipconfig` on the primary server (example):

| Listener: |
|-----------|

![1736794588382](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736794588382.png)

Cluster IP may be assigned to an interface of one of the servers (often primary, but not necessarily). Example of a same-subnet secondary replica holding cluster IP:

| Cluster: |
|----------|

![1736794690093](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736794690093.png)

The cluster and listener each have 2 IP addresses. When the primary is on subnet `241`, the secondary subnet listener IP is offline:

![1736795622794](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795622794.png)

After failover to the second subnet:

![1736795651979](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795651979.png)

> The cluster is reluctant to change its IP address or host solely by failover if a healthy node remains in the original subnet. Example: primary moved Node1 ‚Üí Node3, cluster IP remained on Node2.

When all nodes on the primary subnet failed, the cluster IP also switched:

![1736795688921](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795688921.png)

![1736795697520](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795697520.png)

> Both cluster and listener can only be online on 1 subnet at a time. To serve applications transparently, you may require IP forwarding or dynamic connection string handling.

Failover example when Node1 & Node2 failed:

![1736795744514](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795744514.png)

The interface of Node3 shows 3 IP addresses above.

---

## 2. Testing the Availability Group üß™

Logically there is no difference between any nodes in this cluster regarding roles (`primary`, `synchronous`, `asynchronous`, `automatic failover`, etc.).

| Secondary Subnet Node: |
|------------------------|

![1736795855762](image/setup_MSSQL_multisubnet_AlwaysOn-Copy(2)/1736795855762.png)

All failover scenarios were tested (automatic failover, manual failover, forced failover to secondary subnet node, etc.).
